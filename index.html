    <h1>GHANANIAN CULTURE</h1>
       <div class="text-box"><p>Ghana is a free country where
           the people value it's traditions.In Ghana,Akan names are derived
           from Ghananian culture .Frequenly in Ghana ,children are given 
           their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day
           in the week they were born.Most people do know when their birthdays 
           are,but some might not know what day of the week they were born.
           Luckily,I have created a webpage for calculating the day of the week
           from a specific date.Here is a link to the webpage </p>
